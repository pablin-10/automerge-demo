# Auto-merge demo

Edit this README in a pull request to test GitHub auto-merge.

How to demo:
- Enable auto-merge on the PR.
- Optionally add branch protection to require the "Wait 30s and pass" check and a review.
- The workflow sleeps 30 seconds, then passes; the PR will merge automatically when requirements are met.
